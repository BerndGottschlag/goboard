    Goboard power supply circuitry

compatible: "power-supply"

include: base.yaml

properties:
    io-channels:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: |
        Battery voltage - the first array entry is the low-side battery, the
        second is the high-side battery.

    vbatt-output-ohms:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Resistance of the lower leg of the voltage divider

    vbatt-full-ohms:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Resistance of the full path through the voltage divider.

        If absent or zero the driver assumes that the upper leg is a
        resistance-based sensor.

    vbatt-power-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: |
        Control power to the voltage divider inputs.

        If present the corresponding GPIO must be set to an active level
        to enable the divider input.

    charge-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: |
        Charge the batteries.

    discharge-low-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: |
        Discharge the first (low, connected to GND) battery.

    discharge-high-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: |
        Discharge the second (high, connected to VBATT) battery.
